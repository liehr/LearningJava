## Week 1 Learning Goals
- Familiarize with basic Java syntax, operators, and control structures
- Build foundational understanding of Java OOP concepts
- Develop and test two small projects (Calculator, To-Do List) to apply learned concepts

## Daily Progress
- **Day 1:** Learned what `Test Driven Development` is! Tried to incorporate it in developing the Calculator Application.
- **Day 2:** Holy shit! `TDD` takes a lot of time! But today was a huge progress day! CRUD for Todos is done, the calculator is finished and I learned how to test Models.
- **Day 3:** 
- **Day 4:** 
- **Day 5:** 
- **Day 6:** 
- **Day 7:**

## Lessons Learned
- **Learned to use `TDD` even for basic and easy applications like the calculator. It's not convenient in the first place but
thinking more about what the functionality of methods is, even before implementing them is amazing!**
- **Learned how to fully test models. I had to ask ChatGPT how it's possible to modify Objects without modifying the internal state. `Copy Constructors` and `Mapping` when retrieving data.**

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Issue:** When retrieving data with a getter, modifying the data without calling an update function. This changes the internal state of the object.
    - **Solution:** Using `Copy Constructors` and `Mapping` the Objects with it, so the internal state won't change.

## Project Summaries
- **Calculator:** Overall very easy. Learned to work with double instead of int. Had to learn the hard way, that using Math Libs isn't bad when extreme precision isn't necessary!
- **To-Do List Application:**

## Next Steps
- **More to add**
