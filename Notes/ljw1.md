## Week 1 Learning Goals
- Familiarize with basic Java syntax, operators, and control structures
- Build foundational understanding of Java OOP concepts
- Develop and test two small projects (Calculator, To-Do List) to apply learned concepts

## Daily Progress
- **Day 1:** Learned what `Test Driven Development` is! Tried to incorporate it in developing the Calculator Application.
- **Day 2:** 
- **Day 3:** 
- **Day 4:** 
- **Day 5:** 
- **Day 6:** 
- **Day 7:**

## Lessons Learned
- **Learned to use `TDD` even for basic and easy applications like the calculator. It's not convenient in the first place but
thinking more about what the functionality of methods is, even before implementing them is amazing!**
