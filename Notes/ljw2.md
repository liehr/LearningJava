## Week 2 Learning Goals
- Learn how file I/O works in Java
- Learn how to read JSON Files
- Develop and test two small projects (Contact Book, Mini E-Commerce) to apply learned concepts

## Daily Progress
- **Day 1:** Wrote a good majority of ContactTests and implemented most of the Contact Model.
- **Day 2:** Wrote the rest of the ContactTests and fully implemented the Contact Model.
- **Day 3:** Nothing really happened because I wrote on my master thesis.
- **Day 4:** Learned a lot about File I/O in Java.
- **Day 5:** Learned about Jackson and wrote the JsonFileServiceTests.
- **Day 6:** 
- **Day 7:** 

## Lessons Learned
- **Learned to test File I/O. Most of these Tests are a little weird, because I had to use temp-files**

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Issue:** JSON has a specific format and can be corrupted easily.
  - **Solution:** If JSON File gets corrupted, back it up as a backup_ File and give the user a Empty List as a fallback value.

## Project Summaries
- **Calculator:** Overall very easy. Learned to work with double instead of int. Had to learn the hard way, that using Math Libs isn't bad when extreme precision isn't necessary!
- **To-Do List Application:** Learned to fully test models and small applications that use the model.
- **Bank Account Simulator:** Learned what mutable and immutable fundamentally is. Loved to look at functional mutation approaches. Added a class called `Transactio` that symbolizes a real transaction between two bank accounts!

## Next Steps
- **ContactBook Application with File I/O. I have no idea how this works using Java. But using `JSON` for storing and retrieving data would be a nifty idea.
